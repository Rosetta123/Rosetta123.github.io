I just learned from my course STAT 385 which is a funny and usefull programming course teaching me R language, I am learning Tidyverse to do data analysis. By now I make a progress to use github and R language which I believe that some day I could be a code guru.

Here are two projects I have done in STAT 385 and a independent study draft which I just start it with my friend foucsing on effects of COVID-19 of East-Asia economy.
